The game opens in start mode with 3 buttons: the start button starts the game, the mute button stops the game music, the exit button closes the game.  When you start the game our character Dino has to jump over the incoming cacti with the up arrow key and he gets 1 point. If he collides with a bee he gets 3 points, if he collides with a bomb he loses 1 point. If he hits the cactus, the game ends. The game ends successfully when the score is 10 points. If the score falls below 0, the game ends.
